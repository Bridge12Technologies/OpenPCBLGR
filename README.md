## Contents
This repository contains CAD files (solidworks and STEP files), 3d printer files (STL), KiCAD project files, 
PCB gerber files, bill of materials (BOM), and the assembly manual.

In 2023 Thorsten Maly [(@thmaly)](https://twitter.com/thmaly) presented a workshop at the 62<sup>nd</sup> [Rocky Mountain Conference](https://rockychem.com/) on the design and assembly of the OpenPCBLGR. The presentation is available in the manuals folder of the the repository or for download on the [OpenPCBLGR Webpage](https://www.bridge12.com/learn/open-pcb-lgr/).

## Assembly Manual
The assembly manual for Rev1.0 is found in the [Assembly Manual](Manual/PCB%20LGR%20Assembly%20Instructions%20Rev1.0.docx) word document.

## Ordering PCBs
If no modifications to the resonator are required, the gerber files can be uploaded directly to the manufacturer's website ([JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)).
